Here are a few tips to help you adjust to your new life as an international student. More than 6.3 million students travel away from their home country to pursue higher education internationally. Choosing to study abroad is an exciting opportunity, but there is so much to plan and prepare for â how should you get started?How to Survive Abroad as an International StudentFor most students, the first week after arriving at their new university is the most challenging time of their entire study abroad experience. Not only will you be dealing with overcoming homesickness, but you also will be adapting to a new culture, language, and more. To make this journey a little easier for you, here are a few top tips for international students looking to find out how to survive overseas as an international student.1. Make a Budget for Your Life OverseasDepending on where you are studying, you may have a high cost of living. Planning early can help you cover these costs â here are some studying abroad tips on how to make a budget as a college student.Â Living costs can vary significantly across different countries. Usually, living in highly populated, urban regions is more expensive than living in less-populated areas with smaller suburbs and towns. Cost of living may vary depending on:Housing on campus or renting apartments off campusMeal plans, personal grocery shopping, or eating outTraveling by public transport or by carEntertainment, extracurriculars, and other personal spending habitsHaving a part-time jobÂ Websites like Numbeo can give you an idea of costs of living around the world. You can compare these costs with your expected budget to narrow down the possible locations where you may pursue your studies. Once you have an estimate of costs of living in your new home, you can determine other expenses, like tuition, fees, and rent, with an online student budget calculator.Â Splitting your expenses into essentials and non-essentials is the easiest way to organize your budget.

      "Having a small emergency fund in your budget is also important to plan for in case of the unexpected.2. Develop Your Language SkillsLanguage barriers do not need to be an obstacle when you move overseas. Many Shorelight programs have English-language programs to improve both your academic and speaking skills. You can also improve your English with online tutorials, podcasts, and even TV shows and movies.Here are a few top tips for international students who want to learn English:Learn English from expert instructors, locals, or mentors â Many universities, including Shorelight universities, offer English-language classes to improve your speaking, grammar, and academic English skills.Â Download a language app or English podcast â Use an English-language app like Duolingo or listen to English-language podcasts like the British Councilâs LearnEnglish podcasts. Podcasts often have transcripts (e.g., a written version of the audio) that allows you to listen and read along at the same time.Â Watch TV â TV sitcoms have more realistic usage of the English language and can help you improve your conversational skills, teach you about various cultural references, and give you a better understanding of different kinds of humor. Many streaming services offer subtitles, so you can also read and follow along as you watch.Â Change your computerâs default language â This is arguably the easiest step to take. Learning to navigate technology in the language you wish to learn is a great way to keep that language fresh in your mind every day â and to learn new words that will soon become common in your daily life.Vary your friend group â Making friends with local students is one of the best ways to improve your language fluency, as you can improve through conversing with them regularly, learning from how they speak, and asking them questions.Â Read a book you already know well â There are many best-selling books that have been translated to a variety of different languages. If you have read a specific book in your native language, try to find an English version of the same book. The familiarity of the story should help you understand the language even better.Carry a dictionary with you â Pocket dictionaries can help with conversations or in class if you need to look up specific words.Â 3. Join a Society or ClubÂ Universities offer a wide range of student-run organizations and societies you can join. Whether you are interested in sports, drama, music, debate, or another area of interest, you can find a student society or club full of other students with the same interests. Clubs and societies can also be a great way to adjust to your new environment and find friends.Â Here are a few tips for international students abroad on why you should join a club or society:Explore your interests â Clubs can help you explore your interests and learn new things outside the classroom. This can be a great break from your studies and makes you feel more comfortable on campus.Discover new hobbies â Hobbies can reduce stress and create connections with people who share your interests. When you join a campus organization or club, you can try out new hobbies to find one that is fun and interesting for you.Meet new people â Student organizations and campus clubs are made up of people who share similar interests. You might find a new friend at an international student organization meeting. Friends and connections can improve your college experience: Getting advice from other students can be one of the best ways to adjust to a new culture.Build your resume â When you first go looking for a job, you may not have a lot of experience in your industry. Involvement in clubs or organizations can show future employers you have important skills like teamwork, communication, organization, and leadership. You may even discover new opportunities through someone you meet!Improve your English â Communicating with members of your club gives you constant opportunities to practice and improve your English on a regular basis.4. Immerse Yourself in the CultureÂ Learning about and adjusting to a foreign culture can be challenging for most international students. One of the most common challenges is dealing with culture shock, and you may miss home while you are still getting used to life abroad. This is completely normal: Many international students experience culture shock, and there are several ways you can prepare for your new cultural experiences.Here are a few top tips for international students on how to immerse yourself in the local culture:Research social norms â By familiarizing yourself with these norms before you start university, it can be easier to make friends and avoid cultural misunderstandings.Have an open mindset and embrace diversity â With an open mind, you can meet people from all walks of life, learn from their diverse perspectives, and explore new ideas.Visit restaurants and other local attractions â One of the best ways to adjust to a new culture is by stepping out and exploring the many establishments around you. Try out new food, visit a park, participate in a new activity, and discover everything the country has to offer. As you become more familiar with where you live, you may start to feel more comfortable!5. Build a Strong Network of SupportÂ During the transition from your home country to your university, the admissions office or international student office at your university can be a great source of help. Taking part in orientation at the beginning of your program is an ideal way to get accustomed to life overseas, while also making friends with other new students.Other forms of support will come from your new friends, academic advisors, and/or counselors. Many schools have counselors and therapists, trained to work with students just like you, who are ready to discuss ways you can reduce stress of moving to a new country, adjusting to classroom culture, and more.Â Another great way to build your new support network and learn how to survive abroad as a student is by getting involved in the social aspects of campus life. Research the clubs and organizations on your schoolâs website and get involved â soon, youâll feel at home and part of the school community.Â 6. Familiarize Yourself with Local LawsAs an international student, it is important to familiarize yourself with the laws of your city. Keep in mind, any kind of infraction with the law can affect your status as an international student, so being aware in advance can avoid future problems.Â When it comes to the laws of the country where youâre living and studying, you should be familiar with:Â Following your visa conditions â Depending on your student visa category, there are several conditions that must be followed to maintain your status as an international student, such as academic requirements to stay in good standing, how many hours per week you may work, and more.Knowing your rights â As an international student, certain countries have legal frameworks that protect your rights, such as the Global Convention on Higher Education and (for Australian students) the Education Services for Overseas Students Act. It entitles you to receive accurate information on immigration regulations, university programs, insurance, and taxes and to seek legal help in case of any violation. Read up on these frameworks ahead of time so that you have a point of future reference.Complying with local regulations â Be aware of local laws, including speed limits when driving, when local parks close, and other regional considerations. If you have questions about what is allowed, reach out to your student advisors for specific guidance. 7. Make Several Copies of Your Passport and Important DocumentsIn case of loss or damage, itâs smart to have backup copies of all your documents that are easily accessible if needed, especially if requested by school and/or immigration officials. (Once you have obtained your visa, visit your countryâs customs and border protection website for more information about how you should prepare to enter the country and what to bring.)Â You should have backup copies of the following documents in case of an emergency:PassportFlight documentsStudent visaForm I-20Admissions letterHealth insuranceÂ Medical recordsPrescriptionsÂ Academic documentsList of emergency contactsÂ Specified forms/documents required by the country you are traveling to8. Make Sure You Have Health Insurance Coverage While AbroadÂ Many colleges and universities require you to have active health insurance coverage while you are enrolled, so consider researching which coverage is right for you in advance. Health insurance policies and costs can vary depending on where you plan to study, and some universities may also offer their own plans to students.You can get student health insurance any time before or after arriving, depending on where you plan to study; you can search online to compare different student health insurance options. Depending on the policy, your coverage can start as soon as the day after purchase. Before purchasing any health insurance policy, first look up your universityâs requirements to make sure you are getting an approved form of coverage.Â There are a few types of student health insurance you can choose from:A. Mandatory group planÂ Some universities have their own health insurance plans with predetermined coverage that international students must purchase. This is known as a mandatory group plan.Â Here are a few key features in this plan:The cost is automatically added to your tuition billThey usually cost more than individual plansThey provide comprehensive coverage includingMaternityÂ Pre-existing conditions without a waiting periodMental healthWellnessPreventative careB. Mandatory Group with Option to WaiveSome schools offer a mandatory insurance plan with predetermined coverage, but students are allowed to opt out. This option is allowed only if your individual plan is equally comprehensive and adequate.Â C. Optional PlanÂ With optional plans, the school wonât offer you a mandatory plan with predetermined coverage; instead, students are free to select whichever plan they like.Â 9. Make Sure You Understand the Grading System at Your UniversityAs a student, you will need to keep up your grades, and the grading system at your university or college may be very different from what you are used to. While grading systems can differ slightly based on your university, the most commonly used system is the GPA system on a 4.0 grading scale. This can vary â for example, some institutions in India use a 10-point GPA system. Here is an example of the different kinds of grading systems used in several countries:US Percentage\n",

Make Sure You Come Prepared with a Valid Visa for the Duration of Your StayÂ After you are accepted at a college or university, the school will send the relevant forms you need to begin applying for your visa. Student visas are issued based on when you submit the relevant documents, but usually take a few months to process. The exact documents you need to submit will differ depending on your university or collegeâs country.When entering the country you will be studying in, make sure you arrive no more than 30 days before you begin classes.

If you miss any deadlines or need to know more about how to successfully maintain your status, ask your academic advisor or university official.11. Save Some Money for Traveling Around the CountryHaving a dedicated savings account for travel while you are studying abroad can help you stick to your savings plan and reach your travel goals sooner. There are a few top tips for international students when it comes to saving up for travel. You can start by opening up a separate savings account and setting up a regularly scheduled deposit for the account.

Be Aware of All Housing Options Available to YouÂ Choosing where you want to live abroad is important, as it impacts your living expenses and affects how easily you can travel to university and around the city you call home. Your housing options will depend on your university and surrounding region, and can range from shared dorms on campus to private apartments.Â Many international students prefer the social atmosphere of shared housing because it helps them make friends and can be less costly compared to living alone. Living on campus can be a good option if you want to stay close to the student community and get to your classes faster. You can still access a variety of dining, entertainment, and fitness locations, and it may be more comfortable and familiar.A shared apartment might suit you better if you want to live communally, while also having more independence and privacy. Depending on the apartment you choose, you may have your own bedroom while sharing the kitchen, bathroom, and living space with your housemates. This can also be a good option if you plan to explore your city as it may be more centrally located than your university campus.If you want international student advice about housing, you can speak to your Shorelight advisor or reach out to your universityâs International Student Office. They will give you resources to local rental listings and can also recommend leasing agents.Â 14. Seek Out Friendly FacesItâs exciting to adapt to your new home â but every so often, you may want to experience the familiar. Many universities have a wide variety of cultural student-run organizations and societies where you can connect with a community of people from your home region. Speak with the international student services at your university for support and guidance on how to get involved.Â 15. Make Sure You Know How to Get Your Textbooks Before Classes StartYou have two main options for obtaining your textbooks: purchasing or renting.Purchasing your textbooks gives you the freedom to write notes and highlight content in the books as you need, and you do not have to worry about not having the book when you need it. There are many used bookstores and online markets that can help you find textbooks at a lower price. Once you are done with the textbook, you have the option of selling it to another student or to a secondhand store to earn a part of the cost back.You can also choose to rent your book for a much lower cost compared to purchasing it, but you must return the book in good condition. Keep track of how long you need the book for your class and plan your rental period ahead of time.16. Get to Know Your CampusÂ By getting familiar with your campus, you become more comfortable with your new environment and can adjust better to the culture. Your first-year orientation is a great introduction to your new school, its systems and processes, professors, and more. Before you arrive, you can also take an initial look at videos and virtual tours on the universityâs website â this may help you adjust easier once you arrive.17. Speak Up for What You Believe In - Vote for Important University Matters When You CanAs an international student, your opinion and perspective matter, especially when it comes to university policies and procedures. Most universities encourage students to get involved to make their campus communities as vibrant, equitable, and inclusive as possible. When given the option to voice your concerns or weigh in on important university decisions, be sure to speak up and cast your vote. It could make a difference!Remember, you can always rely on your friends and advisors if you want to make your voice heard on something that is important to you personally. They can guide you to the right avenues you can use to voice your opinion and the right officials you need to speak to. You can also join campus clubs and/or local community organizations to get involved with the causes you care about.End of Sticky Service Ad18. If You Donât Know Something, Just Ask!As an international student, it is completely normal to be unsure about certain aspects of your life in a new country. In these cases, donât hesitate to ask questions to resolve your concerns. Always reach out to your universityâs international student services, advisor, or a university official as they can provide you with firsthand information and help for international students â and can help you find answers.Â Remember that you can also ask people around you! If you ever need help on or off campus, such as finding your way around, getting public transport times, or figuring out other daily life concerns, you can always ask someone nearby for more information.Â 19. Enjoy Your Time AbroadÂ Moving to a different country can be exciting as you get to explore a diverse range of locations, cultures, and experiences. Every city and town has its own charm â you could visit iconic landmarks, visit world-famous attractions, explore national parks, take a swim at a beach, and so much more. Relax at a park, go hiking with your friends, attend music festivals â the possibilities are endless!International students aiming to grow as professionals can also access many opportunities.

Many streaming services offer subtitles, so you can also read and follow along as you watch.Â Change your computerâs default language â This is arguably the easiest step to take. Learning to navigate technology in the language you wish to learn is a great way to keep that language fresh in your mind every day â and to learn new words that will soon become common in your daily life.Vary your friend group â Making friends with local students is one of the best ways to improve your language fluency, as you can improve through conversing with them regularly, learning from how they speak, and asking them questions.Â Read a book you already know well â There are many best-selling books that have been translated to a variety of different languages. If you have read a specific book in your native language, try to find an English version of the same book. The familiarity of the story should help you understand the language even better.Carry a dictionary with you â Pocket dictionaries can help with conversations or in class if you need to look up specific words.Â 3. Join a Society or ClubÂ Universities offer a wide range of student-run organizations and societies you can join.

You may even discover new opportunities through someone you meet!Improve your English â Communicating with members of your club gives you constant opportunities to practice and improve your English on a regular basis.4. Immerse Yourself in the CultureÂ Learning about and adjusting to a foreign culture can be challenging for most international students.

This is completely normal: Many international students experience culture shock, and there are several ways you can prepare for your new cultural experiences.Here are a few top tips for international students on how to immerse yourself in the local culture:Research social norms â By familiarizing yourself with these norms before you start university, it can be easier to make friends and avoid cultural misunderstandings.Have an open mindset and embrace diversity â With an open mind, you can meet people from all walks of life, learn from their diverse perspectives, and explore new ideas.Visit restaurants and other local attractions â One of the best ways to adjust to a new culture is by stepping out and exploring the many establishments around you. Try out new food, visit a park, participate in a new activity, and discover everything the country has to offer. As you become more familiar with where you live, you may start to feel more comfortable!5. Build a Strong Network of SupportÂ During the transition from your home country to your university, the admissions office or international student office at your university can be a great source of help. Taking part in orientation at the beginning of your program is an ideal way to get accustomed to life overseas, while also making friends with other new students.Other forms of support will come from your new friends, academic advisors, and/or counselors. Many schools have counselors and therapists, trained to work with students just like you, who are ready to discuss ways you can reduce stress of moving to a new country, adjusting to classroom culture, and more.Â Another great way to build your new support network and learn how to survive abroad as a student is by getting involved in the social aspects of campus life. Research the clubs and organizations on your schoolâs website and get involved â soon, youâll feel at home and part of the school community.Â 6. Familiarize Yourself with Local LawsAs an international student, it is important to familiarize yourself with the laws of your city. Keep in mind, any kind of infraction with the law can affect your status as an international student, so being aware in advance can avoid future problems.Â When it comes to the laws of the country where youâre living and studying, you should be familiar with:Â Following your visa conditions â Depending on your student visa category, there are several conditions that must be followed to maintain your status as an international student, such as academic requirements to stay in good standing, how many hours per week you may work, and more.Knowing your rights â As an international student, certain countries have legal frameworks that protect your rights, such as the Global Convention on Higher Education and (for Australian students) the Education Services for Overseas Students Act. It entitles you to receive accurate information on immigration regulations, university programs, insurance, and taxes and to seek legal help in case of any violation. Read up on these frameworks ahead of time so that you have a point of future reference.Complying with local regulations â Be aware of local laws, including speed limits when driving, when local parks close, and other regional considerations. If you have questions about what is allowed, reach out to your student advisors for specific guidance. 7. Make Several Copies of Your Passport and Important DocumentsIn case of loss or damage, itâs smart to have backup copies of all your documents that are easily accessible if needed, especially if requested by school and/or immigration officials. (Once you have obtained your visa, visit your countryâs customs and border protection website for more information about how you should prepare to enter the country and what to bring.)Â You should have backup copies of the following documents in case of an emergency:PassportFlight documentsStudent visaForm I-20Admissions letterHealth insuranceÂ Medical recordsPrescriptionsÂ Academic documentsList of emergency contactsÂ Specified forms/documents required by the country you are traveling to8. Make Sure You Have Health Insurance Coverage While AbroadÂ Many colleges and universities require you to have active health insurance coverage while you are enrolled, so consider researching which coverage is right for you in advance. Health insurance policies and costs can vary depending on where you plan to study, and some universities may also offer their own plans to students.You can get student health insurance any time before or after arriving, depending on where you plan to study; you can search online to compare different student health insurance options. Depending on the policy, your coverage can start as soon as the day after purchase.

Make Sure You Understand the Grading System at Your UniversityAs a student, you will need to keep up your grades, and the grading system at your university or college may be very different from what you are used to. While grading systems can differ slightly based on your university, the most commonly used system is the GPA system on a 4.0 grading scale.

Once you are done with the textbook, you have the option of selling it to another student or to a secondhand store to earn a part of the cost back.You can also choose to rent your book for a much lower cost compared to purchasing it, but you must return the book in good condition.

Before you arrive, you can also take an initial look at videos and virtual tours on the universityâs website â this may help you adjust easier once you arrive.17. Speak Up for What You Believe In - Vote for Important University Matters When You CanAs an international student, your opinion and perspective matter, especially when it comes to university policies and procedures. Most universities encourage students to get involved to make their campus communities as vibrant, equitable, and inclusive as possible.

This is completely normal: Many international students experience culture shock, and there are several ways you can prepare for your new cultural experiences.Here are a few top tips for international students on how to immerse yourself in the local culture:Research social norms â By familiarizing yourself with these norms before you start university, it can be easier to make friends and avoid cultural misunderstandings.Have an open mindset and embrace diversity â With an open mind, you can meet people from all walks of life, learn from their diverse perspectives, and explore new ideas.Visit restaurants and other local attractions â One of the best ways to adjust to a new culture is by stepping out and exploring the many establishments around you. Try out new food, visit a park, participate in a new activity, and discover everything the country has to offer. As you become more familiar with where you live, you may start to feel more comfortable!5. Build a Strong Network of SupportÂ During the transition from your home country to your university, the admissions office or international student office at your university can be a great source of help. Taking part in orientation at the beginning of your program is an ideal way to get accustomed to life overseas, while also making friends with other new students.Other forms of support will come from your new friends, academic advisors, and/or counselors. Many schools have counselors and therapists, trained to work with students just like you, who are ready to discuss ways you can reduce stress of moving to a new country, adjusting to classroom culture, and more.Â Another great way to build your new support network and learn how to survive abroad as a student is by getting involved in the social aspects of campus life. Research the clubs and organizations on your schoolâs website and get involved â soon, youâll feel at home and part of the school community.Â 6. Familiarize Yourself with Local LawsAs an international student, it is important to familiarize yourself with the laws of your city. Keep in mind, any kind of infraction with the law can affect your status as an international student, so being aware in advance can avoid future problems.Â When it comes to the laws of the country where youâre living and studying, you should be familiar with:Â Following your visa conditions â Depending on your student visa category, there are several conditions that must be followed to maintain your status as an international student, such as academic requirements to stay in good standing, how many hours per week you may work, and more.Knowing your rights â As an international student, certain countries have legal frameworks that protect your rights, such as the Global Convention on Higher Education and (for Australian students) the Education Services for Overseas Students Act. It entitles you to receive accurate information on immigration regulations, university programs, insurance, and taxes and to seek legal help in case of any violation. Read up on these frameworks ahead of time so that you have a point of future reference.Complying with local regulations â Be aware of local laws, including speed limits when driving, when local parks close, and other regional considerations. If you have questions about what is allowed, reach out to your student advisors for specific guidance. 7. Make Several Copies of Your Passport and Important DocumentsIn case of loss or damage, itâs smart to have backup copies of all your documents that are easily accessible if needed, especially if requested by school and/or immigration officials. (Once you have obtained your visa, visit your countryâs customs and border protection website for more information about how you should prepare to enter the country and what to bring.)Â You should have backup copies of the following documents in case of an emergency:PassportFlight documentsStudent visaForm I-20Admissions letterHealth insuranceÂ Medical recordsPrescriptionsÂ Academic documentsList of emergency contactsÂ Specified forms/documents required by the country you are traveling to8. Make Sure You Have Health Insurance Coverage While AbroadÂ Many colleges and universities require you to have active health insurance coverage while you are enrolled, so consider researching which coverage is right for you in advance. Health insurance policies and costs can vary depending on where you plan to study, and some universities may also offer their own plans to students.You can get student health insurance any time before or after arriving, depending on where you plan to study; you can search online to compare different student health insurance options. Depending on the policy, your coverage can start as soon as the day after purchase. Before purchasing any health insurance policy, first look up your universityâs requirements to make sure you are getting an approved form of coverage.Â There are a few types of student health insurance you can choose from:A. Mandatory group planÂ Some universities have their own health insurance plans with predetermined coverage that international students must purchase. This is known as a mandatory group plan.Â Here are a few key features in this plan:The cost is automatically added to your tuition billThey usually cost more than individual plansThey provide comprehensive coverage includingMaternityÂ Pre-existing conditions without a waiting periodMental healthWellnessPreventative careB. Mandatory Group with Option to WaiveSome schools offer a mandatory insurance plan with predetermined coverage, but students are allowed to opt out. This option is allowed only if your individual plan is equally comprehensive and adequate.Â C. Optional PlanÂ With optional plans, the school wonât offer you a mandatory plan with predetermined coverage; instead, students are free to select whichever plan they like.Â 9. Make Sure You Understand the Grading System at Your UniversityAs a student, you will need to keep up your grades, and the grading system at your university or college may be very different from what you are used to. While grading systems can differ slightly based on your university, the most commonly used system is the GPA system on a 4.0 grading scale. This can vary â for example, some institutions in India use a 10-point GPA system. Here is an example of the different kinds of grading systems used in several countries:US Percentage\n",

The exact documents you need to submit will differ depending on your university or collegeâs country.When entering the country you will be studying in, make sure you arrive no more than 30 days before you begin classes.

Be Aware of All Housing Options Available to YouÂ Choosing where you want to live abroad is important, as it impacts your living expenses and affects how easily you can travel to university and around the city you call home. Your housing options will depend on your university and surrounding region, and can range from shared dorms on campus to private apartments.Â Many international students prefer the social atmosphere of shared housing because it helps them make friends and can be less costly compared to living alone. Living on campus can be a good option if you want to stay close to the student community and get to your classes faster. You can still access a variety of dining, entertainment, and fitness locations, and it may be more comfortable and familiar.A shared apartment might suit you better if you want to live communally, while also having more independence and privacy. Depending on the apartment you choose, you may have your own bedroom while sharing the kitchen, bathroom, and living space with your housemates. This can also be a good option if you plan to explore your city as it may be more centrally located than your university campus.If you want international student advice about housing, you can speak to your Shorelight advisor or reach out to your universityâs International Student Office. They will give you resources to local rental listings and can also recommend leasing agents.Â 14. Seek Out Friendly FacesItâs exciting to adapt to your new home â but every so often, you may want to experience the familiar. Many universities have a wide variety of cultural student-run organizations and societies where you can connect with a community of people from your home region. Speak with the international student services at your university for support and guidance on how to get involved.Â 15. Make Sure You Know How to Get Your Textbooks Before Classes StartYou have two main options for obtaining your textbooks: purchasing or renting.Purchasing your textbooks gives you the freedom to write notes and highlight content in the books as you need, and you do not have to worry about not having the book when you need it. There are many used bookstores and online markets that can help you find textbooks at a lower price. Once you are done with the textbook, you have the option of selling it to another student or to a secondhand store to earn a part of the cost back.You can also choose to rent your book for a much lower cost compared to purchasing it, but you must return the book in good condition. Keep track of how long you need the book for your class and plan your rental period ahead of time.16. Get to Know Your CampusÂ By getting familiar with your campus, you become more comfortable with your new environment and can adjust better to the culture. Your first-year orientation is a great introduction to your new school, its systems and processes, professors, and more. Before you arrive, you can also take an initial look at videos and virtual tours on the universityâs website â this may help you adjust easier once you arrive.17. Speak Up for What You Believe In - Vote for Important University Matters When You CanAs an international student, your opinion and perspective matter, especially when it comes to university policies and procedures. Most universities encourage students to get involved to make their campus communities as vibrant, equitable, and inclusive as possible. When given the option to voice your concerns or weigh in on important university decisions, be sure to speak up and cast your vote. It could make a difference!Remember, you can always rely on your friends and advisors if you want to make your voice heard on something that is important to you personally. They can guide you to the right avenues you can use to voice your opinion and the right officials you need to speak to. You can also join campus clubs and/or local community organizations to get involved with the causes you care about.End of Sticky Service Ad18. If You Donât Know Something, Just Ask!As an international student, it is completely normal to be unsure about certain aspects of your life in a new country. In these cases, donât hesitate to ask questions to resolve your concerns. Always reach out to your universityâs international student services, advisor, or a university official as they can provide you with firsthand information and help for international students â and can help you find answers.Â Remember that you can also ask people around you! If you ever need help on or off campus, such as finding your way around, getting public transport times, or figuring out other daily life concerns, you can always ask someone nearby for more information.Â 19. Enjoy Your Time AbroadÂ Moving to a different country can be exciting as you get to explore a diverse range of locations, cultures, and experiences. Every city and town has its own charm â you could visit iconic landmarks, visit world-famous attractions, explore national parks, take a swim at a beach, and so much more.

Planning early can help you cover these costs â here are some studying abroad tips on how to make a budget as a college student.Â Living costs can vary significantly across different countries.

Develop Your Language SkillsLanguage barriers do not need to be an obstacle when you move overseas. Many Shorelight programs have English-language programs to improve both your academic and speaking skills. You can also improve your English with online tutorials, podcasts, and even TV shows and movies.Here are a few top tips for international students who want to learn English:Learn English from expert instructors, locals, or mentors â Many universities, including Shorelight universities, offer English-language classes to improve your speaking, grammar, and academic English skills.Â Download a language app or English podcast â Use an English-language app like Duolingo or listen to English-language podcasts like the British Councilâs LearnEnglish podcasts. Podcasts often have transcripts (e.g., a written version of the audio) that allows you to listen and read along at the same time.Â Watch TV â TV sitcoms have more realistic usage of the English language and can help you improve your conversational skills, teach you about various cultural references, and give you a better understanding of different kinds of humor. Many streaming services offer subtitles, so you can also read and follow along as you watch.Â Change your computerâs default language â This is arguably the easiest step to take. Learning to navigate technology in the language you wish to learn is a great way to keep that language fresh in your mind every day â and to learn new words that will soon become common in your daily life.Vary your friend group â Making friends with local students is one of the best ways to improve your language fluency, as you can improve through conversing with them regularly, learning from how they speak, and asking them questions.Â Read a book you already know well â There are many best-selling books that have been translated to a variety of different languages. If you have read a specific book in your native language, try to find an English version of the same book. The familiarity of the story should help you understand the language even better.Carry a dictionary with you â Pocket dictionaries can help with conversations or in class if you need to look up specific words.Â 3. Join a Society or ClubÂ Universities offer a wide range of student-run organizations and societies you can join. Whether you are interested in sports, drama, music, debate, or another area of interest, you can find a student society or club full of other students with the same interests. Clubs and societies can also be a great way to adjust to your new environment and find friends.Â Here are a few tips for international students abroad on why you should join a club or society:Explore your interests â Clubs can help you explore your interests and learn new things outside the classroom. This can be a great break from your studies and makes you feel more comfortable on campus.Discover new hobbies â Hobbies can reduce stress and create connections with people who share your interests. When you join a campus organization or club, you can try out new hobbies to find one that is fun and interesting for you.Meet new people â Student organizations and campus clubs are made up of people who share similar interests. You might find a new friend at an international student organization meeting. Friends and connections can improve your college experience: Getting advice from other students can be one of the best ways to adjust to a new culture.Build your resume â When you first go looking for a job, you may not have a lot of experience in your industry. Involvement in clubs or organizations can show future employers you have important skills like teamwork, communication, organization, and leadership. You may even discover new opportunities through someone you meet!Improve your English â Communicating with members of your club gives you constant opportunities to practice and improve your English on a regular basis.4. Immerse Yourself in the CultureÂ Learning about and adjusting to a foreign culture can be challenging for most international students. One of the most common challenges is dealing with culture shock, and you may miss home while you are still getting used to life abroad. This is completely normal: Many international students experience culture shock, and there are several ways you can prepare for your new cultural experiences.Here are a few top tips for international students on how to immerse yourself in the local culture:Research social norms â By familiarizing yourself with these norms before you start university, it can be easier to make friends and avoid cultural misunderstandings.Have an open mindset and embrace diversity â With an open mind, you can meet people from all walks of life, learn from their diverse perspectives, and explore new ideas.Visit restaurants and other local attractions â One of the best ways to adjust to a new culture is by stepping out and exploring the many establishments around you. Try out new food, visit a park, participate in a new activity, and discover everything the country has to offer. As you become more familiar with where you live, you may start to feel more comfortable!5. Build a Strong Network of SupportÂ During the transition from your home country to your university, the admissions office or international student office at your university can be a great source of help. Taking part in orientation at the beginning of your program is an ideal way to get accustomed to life overseas, while also making friends with other new students.Other forms of support will come from your new friends, academic advisors, and/or counselors. Many schools have counselors and therapists, trained to work with students just like you, who are ready to discuss ways you can reduce stress of moving to a new country, adjusting to classroom culture, and more.Â Another great way to build your new support network and learn how to survive abroad as a student is by getting involved in the social aspects of campus life. Research the clubs and organizations on your schoolâs website and get involved â soon, youâll feel at home and part of the school community.Â 6. Familiarize Yourself with Local LawsAs an international student, it is important to familiarize yourself with the laws of your city. Keep in mind, any kind of infraction with the law can affect your status as an international student, so being aware in advance can avoid future problems.Â When it comes to the laws of the country where youâre living and studying, you should be familiar with:Â Following your visa conditions â Depending on your student visa category, there are several conditions that must be followed to maintain your status as an international student, such as academic requirements to stay in good standing, how many hours per week you may work, and more.Knowing your rights â As an international student, certain countries have legal frameworks that protect your rights, such as the Global Convention on Higher Education and (for Australian students) the Education Services for Overseas Students Act. It entitles you to receive accurate information on immigration regulations, university programs, insurance, and taxes and to seek legal help in case of any violation. Read up on these frameworks ahead of time so that you have a point of future reference.Complying with local regulations â Be aware of local laws, including speed limits when driving, when local parks close, and other regional considerations. If you have questions about what is allowed, reach out to your student advisors for specific guidance. 7. Make Several Copies of Your Passport and Important DocumentsIn case of loss or damage, itâs smart to have backup copies of all your documents that are easily accessible if needed, especially if requested by school and/or immigration officials.

Once you are done with the textbook, you have the option of selling it to another student or to a secondhand store to earn a part of the cost back.You can also choose to rent your book for a much lower cost compared to purchasing it, but you must return the book in good condition.

Speak Up for What You Believe In - Vote for Important University Matters When You CanAs an international student, your opinion and perspective matter, especially when it comes to university policies and procedures. Most universities encourage students to get involved to make their campus communities as vibrant, equitable, and inclusive as possible. When given the option to voice your concerns or weigh in on important university decisions, be sure to speak up and cast your vote. It could make a difference!Remember, you can always rely on your friends and advisors if you want to make your voice heard on something that is important to you personally.

Many Shorelight programs have English-language programs to improve both your academic and speaking skills. You can also improve your English with online tutorials, podcasts, and even TV shows and movies.Here are a few top tips for international students who want to learn English:Learn English from expert instructors, locals, or mentors â Many universities, including Shorelight universities, offer English-language classes to improve your speaking, grammar, and academic English skills.Â Download a language app or English podcast â Use an English-language app like Duolingo or listen to English-language podcasts like the British Councilâs LearnEnglish podcasts. Podcasts often have transcripts (e.g., a written version of the audio) that allows you to listen and read along at the same time.Â Watch TV â TV sitcoms have more realistic usage of the English language and can help you improve your conversational skills, teach you about various cultural references, and give you a better understanding of different kinds of humor. Many streaming services offer subtitles, so you can also read and follow along as you watch.Â Change your computerâs default language â This is arguably the easiest step to take. Learning to navigate technology in the language you wish to learn is a great way to keep that language fresh in your mind every day â and to learn new words that will soon become common in your daily life.Vary your friend group â Making friends with local students is one of the best ways to improve your language fluency, as you can improve through conversing with them regularly, learning from how they speak, and asking them questions.Â Read a book you already know well â There are many best-selling books that have been translated to a variety of different languages. If you have read a specific book in your native language, try to find an English version of the same book. The familiarity of the story should help you understand the language even better.Carry a dictionary with you â Pocket dictionaries can help with conversations or in class if you need to look up specific words.Â 3. Join a Society or ClubÂ Universities offer a wide range of student-run organizations and societies you can join. Whether you are interested in sports, drama, music, debate, or another area of interest, you can find a student society or club full of other students with the same interests. Clubs and societies can also be a great way to adjust to your new environment and find friends.Â Here are a few tips for international students abroad on why you should join a club or society:Explore your interests â Clubs can help you explore your interests and learn new things outside the classroom. This can be a great break from your studies and makes you feel more comfortable on campus.Discover new hobbies â Hobbies can reduce stress and create connections with people who share your interests. When you join a campus organization or club, you can try out new hobbies to find one that is fun and interesting for you.Meet new people â Student organizations and campus clubs are made up of people who share similar interests. You might find a new friend at an international student organization meeting. Friends and connections can improve your college experience: Getting advice from other students can be one of the best ways to adjust to a new culture.Build your resume â When you first go looking for a job, you may not have a lot of experience in your industry. Involvement in clubs or organizations can show future employers you have important skills like teamwork, communication, organization, and leadership. You may even discover new opportunities through someone you meet!Improve your English â Communicating with members of your club gives you constant opportunities to practice and improve your English on a regular basis.4. Immerse Yourself in the CultureÂ Learning about and adjusting to a foreign culture can be challenging for most international students. One of the most common challenges is dealing with culture shock, and you may miss home while you are still getting used to life abroad. This is completely normal: Many international students experience culture shock, and there are several ways you can prepare for your new cultural experiences.Here are a few top tips for international students on how to immerse yourself in the local culture:Research social norms â By familiarizing yourself with these norms before you start university, it can be easier to make friends and avoid cultural misunderstandings.Have an open mindset and embrace diversity â With an open mind, you can meet people from all walks of life, learn from their diverse perspectives, and explore new ideas.Visit restaurants and other local attractions â One of the best ways to adjust to a new culture is by stepping out and exploring the many establishments around you. Try out new food, visit a park, participate in a new activity, and discover everything the country has to offer. As you become more familiar with where you live, you may start to feel more comfortable!5. Build a Strong Network of SupportÂ During the transition from your home country to your university, the admissions office or international student office at your university can be a great source of help. Taking part in orientation at the beginning of your program is an ideal way to get accustomed to life overseas, while also making friends with other new students.Other forms of support will come from your new friends, academic advisors, and/or counselors. Many schools have counselors and therapists, trained to work with students just like you, who are ready to discuss ways you can reduce stress of moving to a new country, adjusting to classroom culture, and more.Â Another great way to build your new support network and learn how to survive abroad as a student is by getting involved in the social aspects of campus life. Research the clubs and organizations on your schoolâs website and get involved â soon, youâll feel at home and part of the school community.Â 6. Familiarize Yourself with Local LawsAs an international student, it is important to familiarize yourself with the laws of your city. Keep in mind, any kind of infraction with the law can affect your status as an international student, so being aware in advance can avoid future problems.Â When it comes to the laws of the country where youâre living and studying, you should be familiar with:Â Following your visa conditions â Depending on your student visa category, there are several conditions that must be followed to maintain your status as an international student, such as academic requirements to stay in good standing, how many hours per week you may work, and more.Knowing your rights â As an international student, certain countries have legal frameworks that protect your rights, such as the Global Convention on Higher Education and (for Australian students) the Education Services for Overseas Students Act.

Develop Your Language SkillsLanguage barriers do not need to be an obstacle when you move overseas. Many Shorelight programs have English-language programs to improve both your academic and speaking skills. You can also improve your English with online tutorials, podcasts, and even TV shows and movies.Here are a few top tips for international students who want to learn English:Learn English from expert instructors, locals, or mentors â Many universities, including Shorelight universities, offer English-language classes to improve your speaking, grammar, and academic English skills.Â Download a language app or English podcast â Use an English-language app like Duolingo or listen to English-language podcasts like the British Councilâs LearnEnglish podcasts. Podcasts often have transcripts (e.g., a written version of the audio) that allows you to listen and read along at the same time.Â Watch TV â TV sitcoms have more realistic usage of the English language and can help you improve your conversational skills, teach you about various cultural references, and give you a better understanding of different kinds of humor. Many streaming services offer subtitles, so you can also read and follow along as you watch.Â Change your computerâs default language â This is arguably the easiest step to take. Learning to navigate technology in the language you wish to learn is a great way to keep that language fresh in your mind every day â and to learn new words that will soon become common in your daily life.Vary your friend group â Making friends with local students is one of the best ways to improve your language fluency, as you can improve through conversing with them regularly, learning from how they speak, and asking them questions.Â Read a book you already know well â There are many best-selling books that have been translated to a variety of different languages. If you have read a specific book in your native language, try to find an English version of the same book. The familiarity of the story should help you understand the language even better.Carry a dictionary with you â Pocket dictionaries can help with conversations or in class if you need to look up specific words.Â 3. Join a Society or ClubÂ Universities offer a wide range of student-run organizations and societies you can join. Whether you are interested in sports, drama, music, debate, or another area of interest, you can find a student society or club full of other students with the same interests. Clubs and societies can also be a great way to adjust to your new environment and find friends.Â Here are a few tips for international students abroad on why you should join a club or society:Explore your interests â Clubs can help you explore your interests and learn new things outside the classroom. This can be a great break from your studies and makes you feel more comfortable on campus.Discover new hobbies â Hobbies can reduce stress and create connections with people who share your interests. When you join a campus organization or club, you can try out new hobbies to find one that is fun and interesting for you.Meet new people â Student organizations and campus clubs are made up of people who share similar interests. You might find a new friend at an international student organization meeting. Friends and connections can improve your college experience: Getting advice from other students can be one of the best ways to adjust to a new culture.Build your resume â When you first go looking for a job, you may not have a lot of experience in your industry. Involvement in clubs or organizations can show future employers you have important skills like teamwork, communication, organization, and leadership. You may even discover new opportunities through someone you meet!Improve your English â Communicating with members of your club gives you constant opportunities to practice and improve your English on a regular basis.4. Immerse Yourself in the CultureÂ Learning about and adjusting to a foreign culture can be challenging for most international students. One of the most common challenges is dealing with culture shock, and you may miss home while you are still getting used to life abroad. This is completely normal: Many international students experience culture shock, and there are several ways you can prepare for your new cultural experiences.Here are a few top tips for international students on how to immerse yourself in the local culture:Research social norms â By familiarizing yourself with these norms before you start university, it can be easier to make friends and avoid cultural misunderstandings.Have an open mindset and embrace diversity â With an open mind, you can meet people from all walks of life, learn from their diverse perspectives, and explore new ideas.Visit restaurants and other local attractions â One of the best ways to adjust to a new culture is by stepping out and exploring the many establishments around you. Try out new food, visit a park, participate in a new activity, and discover everything the country has to offer. As you become more familiar with where you live, you may start to feel more comfortable!5. Build a Strong Network of SupportÂ During the transition from your home country to your university, the admissions office or international student office at your university can be a great source of help. Taking part in orientation at the beginning of your program is an ideal way to get accustomed to life overseas, while also making friends with other new students.Other forms of support will come from your new friends, academic advisors, and/or counselors. Many schools have counselors and therapists, trained to work with students just like you, who are ready to discuss ways you can reduce stress of moving to a new country, adjusting to classroom culture, and more.Â Another great way to build your new support network and learn how to survive abroad as a student is by getting involved in the social aspects of campus life. Research the clubs and organizations on your schoolâs website and get involved â soon, youâll feel at home and part of the school community.Â 6. Familiarize Yourself with Local LawsAs an international student, it is important to familiarize yourself with the laws of your city. Keep in mind, any kind of infraction with the law can affect your status as an international student, so being aware in advance can avoid future problems.Â When it comes to the laws of the country where youâre living and studying, you should be familiar with:Â Following your visa conditions â Depending on your student visa category, there are several conditions that must be followed to maintain your status as an international student, such as academic requirements to stay in good standing, how many hours per week you may work, and more.Knowing your rights â As an international student, certain countries have legal frameworks that protect your rights, such as the Global Convention on Higher Education and (for Australian students) the Education Services for Overseas Students Act. It entitles you to receive accurate information on immigration regulations, university programs, insurance, and taxes and to seek legal help in case of any violation. Read up on these frameworks ahead of time so that you have a point of future reference.Complying with local regulations â Be aware of local laws, including speed limits when driving, when local parks close, and other regional considerations. If you have questions about what is allowed, reach out to your student advisors for specific guidance. 7. Make Several Copies of Your Passport and Important DocumentsIn case of loss or damage, itâs smart to have backup copies of all your documents that are easily accessible if needed, especially if requested by school and/or immigration officials. (Once you have obtained your visa, visit your countryâs customs and border protection website for more information about how you should prepare to enter the country and what to bring.)Â You should have backup copies of the following documents in case of an emergency:PassportFlight documentsStudent visaForm I-20Admissions letterHealth insuranceÂ Medical recordsPrescriptionsÂ Academic documentsList of emergency contactsÂ Specified forms/documents required by the country you are traveling to8. Make Sure You Have Health Insurance Coverage While AbroadÂ Many colleges and universities require you to have active health insurance coverage while you are enrolled, so consider researching which coverage is right for you in advance. Health insurance policies and costs can vary depending on where you plan to study, and some universities may also offer their own plans to students.You can get student health insurance any time before or after arriving, depending on where you plan to study; you can search online to compare different student health insurance options. Depending on the policy, your coverage can start as soon as the day after purchase. Before purchasing any health insurance policy, first look up your universityâs requirements to make sure you are getting an approved form of coverage.Â There are a few types of student health insurance you can choose from:A. Mandatory group planÂ Some universities have their own health insurance plans with predetermined coverage that international students must purchase. This is known as a mandatory group plan.Â Here are a few key features in this plan:The cost is automatically added to your tuition billThey usually cost more than individual plansThey provide comprehensive coverage includingMaternityÂ Pre-existing conditions without a waiting periodMental healthWellnessPreventative careB. Mandatory Group with Option to WaiveSome schools offer a mandatory insurance plan with predetermined coverage, but students are allowed to opt out. This option is allowed only if your individual plan is equally comprehensive and adequate.Â C. Optional PlanÂ With optional plans, the school wonât offer you a mandatory plan with predetermined coverage; instead, students are free to select whichever plan they like.Â 9. Make Sure You Understand the Grading System at Your UniversityAs a student, you will need to keep up your grades, and the grading system at your university or college may be very different from what you are used to.

As you become more familiar with where you live, you may start to feel more comfortable!5. Build a Strong Network of SupportÂ During the transition from your home country to your university, the admissions office or international student office at your university can be a great source of help. Taking part in orientation at the beginning of your program is an ideal way to get accustomed to life overseas, while also making friends with other new students.Other forms of support will come from your new friends, academic advisors, and/or counselors.

Be Aware of All Housing Options Available to YouÂ Choosing where you want to live abroad is important, as it impacts your living expenses and affects how easily you can travel to university and around the city you call home. Your housing options will depend on your university and surrounding region, and can range from shared dorms on campus to private apartments.Â Many international students prefer the social atmosphere of shared housing because it helps them make friends and can be less costly compared to living alone. Living on campus can be a good option if you want to stay close to the student community and get to your classes faster. You can still access a variety of dining, entertainment, and fitness locations, and it may be more comfortable and familiar.A shared apartment might suit you better if you want to live communally, while also having more independence and privacy. Depending on the apartment you choose, you may have your own bedroom while sharing the kitchen, bathroom, and living space with your housemates. This can also be a good option if you plan to explore your city as it may be more centrally located than your university campus.If you want international student advice about housing, you can speak to your Shorelight advisor or reach out to your universityâs International Student Office. They will give you resources to local rental listings and can also recommend leasing agents.Â 14. Seek Out Friendly FacesItâs exciting to adapt to your new home â but every so often, you may want to experience the familiar.

Speak with the international student services at your university for support and guidance on how to get involved.Â 15. Make Sure You Know How to Get Your Textbooks Before Classes StartYou have two main options for obtaining your textbooks: purchasing or renting.Purchasing your textbooks gives you the freedom to write notes and highlight content in the books as you need, and you do not have to worry about not having the book when you need it. There are many used bookstores and online markets that can help you find textbooks at a lower price. Once you are done with the textbook, you have the option of selling it to another student or to a secondhand store to earn a part of the cost back.You can also choose to rent your book for a much lower cost compared to purchasing it, but you must return the book in good condition. Keep track of how long you need the book for your class and plan your rental period ahead of time.16. Get to Know Your CampusÂ By getting familiar with your campus, you become more comfortable with your new environment and can adjust better to the culture. Your first-year orientation is a great introduction to your new school, its systems and processes, professors, and more. Before you arrive, you can also take an initial look at videos and virtual tours on the universityâs website â this may help you adjust easier once you arrive.17. Speak Up for What You Believe In - Vote for Important University Matters When You CanAs an international student, your opinion and perspective matter, especially when it comes to university policies and procedures. Most universities encourage students to get involved to make their campus communities as vibrant, equitable, and inclusive as possible. When given the option to voice your concerns or weigh in on important university decisions, be sure to speak up and cast your vote. It could make a difference!Remember, you can always rely on your friends and advisors if you want to make your voice heard on something that is important to you personally. They can guide you to the right avenues you can use to voice your opinion and the right officials you need to speak to. You can also join campus clubs and/or local community organizations to get involved with the causes you care about.End of Sticky Service Ad18. If You Donât Know Something, Just Ask!As an international student, it is completely normal to be unsure about certain aspects of your life in a new country. In these cases, donât hesitate to ask questions to resolve your concerns. Always reach out to your universityâs international student services, advisor, or a university official as they can provide you with firsthand information and help for international students â and can help you find answers.Â Remember that you can also ask people around you! If you ever need help on or off campus, such as finding your way around, getting public transport times, or figuring out other daily life concerns, you can always ask someone nearby for more information.Â 19. Enjoy Your Time AbroadÂ Moving to a different country can be exciting as you get to explore a diverse range of locations, cultures, and experiences. Every city and town has its own charm â you could visit iconic landmarks, visit world-famous attractions, explore national parks, take a swim at a beach, and so much more. Relax at a park, go hiking with your friends, attend music festivals â the possibilities are endless!International students aiming to grow as professionals can also access many opportunities.

Your GPA is calculated by dividing the total amount of grade points earned by the total number of credit hours taken.Â 10. Make Sure You Come Prepared with a Valid Visa for the Duration of Your StayÂ After you are accepted at a college or university, the school will send the relevant forms you need to begin applying for your visa. Student visas are issued based on when you submit the relevant documents, but usually take a few months to process. The exact documents you need to submit will differ depending on your university or collegeâs country.When entering the country you will be studying in, make sure you arrive no more than 30 days before you begin classes. As soon as you arrive, contact an academic advisor or university official and they can guide you toward your next steps while providing you with important tips for international students studying abroad. If you miss any deadlines or need to know more about how to successfully maintain your status, ask your academic advisor or university official.11. Save Some Money for Traveling Around the CountryHaving a dedicated savings account for travel while you are studying abroad can help you stick to your savings plan and reach your travel goals sooner. There are a few top tips for international students when it comes to saving up for travel. You can start by opening up a separate savings account and setting up a regularly scheduled deposit for the account. This means that your traveling savings account will always have a fixed amount transferred to it, allowing you to build it up over time, so you can use it when you need it.You will have an endless variety of places to visit, sights to see, and activities to try out! By making sure you have a travel fund, you can make the most of your vacations and experience everything your chosen country has to offer.12.

Be Aware of All Housing Options Available to YouÂ Choosing where you want to live abroad is important, as it impacts your living expenses and affects how easily you can travel to university and around the city you call home. Your housing options will depend on your university and surrounding region, and can range from shared dorms on campus to private apartments.Â Many international students prefer the social atmosphere of shared housing because it helps them make friends and can be less costly compared to living alone. Living on campus can be a good option if you want to stay close to the student community and get to your classes faster. You can still access a variety of dining, entertainment, and fitness locations, and it may be more comfortable and familiar.A shared apartment might suit you better if you want to live communally, while also having more independence and privacy. Depending on the apartment you choose, you may have your own bedroom while sharing the kitchen, bathroom, and living space with your housemates. This can also be a good option if you plan to explore your city as it may be more centrally located than your university campus.If you want international student advice about housing, you can speak to your Shorelight advisor or reach out to your universityâs International Student Office. They will give you resources to local rental listings and can also recommend leasing agents.Â 14. Seek Out Friendly FacesItâs exciting to adapt to your new home â but every so often, you may want to experience the familiar. Many universities have a wide variety of cultural student-run organizations and societies where you can connect with a community of people from your home region. Speak with the international student services at your university for support and guidance on how to get involved.Â 15. Make Sure You Know How to Get Your Textbooks Before Classes StartYou have two main options for obtaining your textbooks: purchasing or renting.Purchasing your textbooks gives you the freedom to write notes and highlight content in the books as you need, and you do not have to worry about not having the book when you need it. There are many used bookstores and online markets that can help you find textbooks at a lower price. Once you are done with the textbook, you have the option of selling it to another student or to a secondhand store to earn a part of the cost back.You can also choose to rent your book for a much lower cost compared to purchasing it, but you must return the book in good condition. Keep track of how long you need the book for your class and plan your rental period ahead of time.16. Get to Know Your CampusÂ By getting familiar with your campus, you become more comfortable with your new environment and can adjust better to the culture. Your first-year orientation is a great introduction to your new school, its systems and processes, professors, and more. Before you arrive, you can also take an initial look at videos and virtual tours on the universityâs website â this may help you adjust easier once you arrive.17. Speak Up for What You Believe In - Vote for Important University Matters When You CanAs an international student, your opinion and perspective matter, especially when it comes to university policies and procedures. Most universities encourage students to get involved to make their campus communities as vibrant, equitable, and inclusive as possible. When given the option to voice your concerns or weigh in on important university decisions, be sure to speak up and cast your vote. It could make a difference!Remember, you can always rely on your friends and advisors if you want to make your voice heard on something that is important to you personally. They can guide you to the right avenues you can use to voice your opinion and the right officials you need to speak to. You can also join campus clubs and/or local community organizations to get involved with the causes you care about.End of Sticky Service Ad18. If You Donât Know Something, Just Ask!As an international student, it is completely normal to be unsure about certain aspects of your life in a new country. In these cases, donât hesitate to ask questions to resolve your concerns. Always reach out to your universityâs international student services, advisor, or a university official as they can provide you with firsthand information and help for international students â and can help you find answers.Â Remember that you can also ask people around you! If you ever need help on or off campus, such as finding your way around, getting public transport times, or figuring out other daily life concerns, you can always ask someone nearby for more information.Â 19. Enjoy Your Time AbroadÂ Moving to a different country can be exciting as you get to explore a diverse range of locations, cultures, and experiences. Every city and town has its own charm â you could visit iconic landmarks, visit world-famous attractions, explore national parks, take a swim at a beach, and so much more. Relax at a park, go hiking with your friends, attend music festivals â the possibilities are endless!International students aiming to grow as professionals can also access many opportunities.
